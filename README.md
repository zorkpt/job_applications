# Job Application Tracking Platform
The Job Application Tracking Platform is a web-based application that allows users to keep track of job applications they have submitted. The application allows users to:

- Create an account
- Add job applications with information such as company name, position applied for, and date applied
- Update the status of each application
- View all of their job applications
- Filter them by status
- Delete them

The application uses a Postgres database to store the job application data, and it has been implemented using C# and the .NET framework, with a focus on the use of Azure services.

This repository contains the code for the back-end of the application, including the data access layer, implemented using the repository pattern, and the API REST using ASP.NET Core. The front-end of the application can be found in a separate repository.
